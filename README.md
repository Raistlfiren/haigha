# Haigha: Alice fixtures for tables

[Alice](https://github.com/nelmio/alice) is great for database fixtures library.
It works with Doctrine out-of-the-box, but it needs a custom persister if your application uses something else.

This is where Haigha comes in: it lets you use Alice with plain database tables!

## How to use Haigha in your application

Simply add Haigha to your composer.json (in the require-dev section if you only use it for your testsuite).
